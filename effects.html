                <h2>Political Consequences</h2>
                <p>
                    The Peace of Westphalia brought the war to an end in 1648. The war had lasting effects on the power structure within Europe.  The states within the Empire became even more decentralized after the end enjoying greater freedoms from Imperial rule.  The territory of nations also became more clearly structure and defined.
