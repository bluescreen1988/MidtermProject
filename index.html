                <h2>The Thirty Years War</h2>
                <p>
                    The Thirty Years' War was a devasting conflict that took place at the beginning of the 17th century.  Starting in 1618 the war would become one of the most destructive conflicts in human history with over eight million fatalities from violence, famine, and plague.  The conflict took place primarily within the borders of the Holy Roman Empire.  Twenty percent of the population of Germany died during the period.

                <h2>Cause of the War</h2>
                <p>
                    In the decades before the war an uneasy religious truce had existed between the loosely organized states of the Holy Roman Empire.  However, the election of Ferdinand II to the throne who was a proud Catholic set in motion the events that would lead to the bloodiest conflict that Europe had ever seen.
